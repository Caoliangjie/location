\maketitle
\par Last Friday, Microsoft has updated its flagship operating system Windows to help us get more stuff done. The new release, which is creatively called the ¡°Windows April 2018 Update¡± ¡ª introduces three major features. There's a new timeline view, a feature to help you ignore distractions, and improved voice control. And The spirit of this release is how it can help you get back time. The Timeline feature fits into that trend, by creating a view that lets you see what work you¡¯re doing in Microsoft programs across devices. If you are working on a Word document on your iPhone or your Android tablet on your train ride into work, for example, Timeline allows for whatever you¡¯re working on in transit to show up on your work PC when you get into the office. Meanwhile, the feature will shut off your notifications for set periods of time to keep you from getting distracted.

It's now possible to control your Cortana-compatible smart-home devices from your PC. Although, It used to be Microsoft's most lucrative product, a crown it has ceded to Office, Microsoft's server business and even its gaming business in the past decade, it used to be Microsoft's most lucrative product, a crown it has ceded to Office, Microsoft's server business and even its gaming business in the past decade.
