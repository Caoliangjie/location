\par Recently, Applebee's found malware on its payment systems in 167 locations across 15 states, potentially exposing customer credit card data. The barrage of data breaches at restaurants and other businesses highlights the heightened risks of identity theft and the continued vulnerabilities presented by payment systems, databases of customer information, and mobile apps. Now it is working with independent experts to investigate to investigate the issue. We hope the company can keep our data safe when we give them our information trustfully.
