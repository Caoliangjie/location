\maketitle
\par Brain-computer\cite{Wolpaw2000Brain} interface maybe change what it means to human(see Fig.{\color{red}1}). TECHNOLOGIES are often billed as transformative. For instance, William Kochevar is paralyzed below shoulder and yet has managed to feed himself by his own hand. And the signals are detected by implants in his brain and processed into commands to activate the electrodes in his arms.

\par The pace of research into BCIs\cite{Beverina2003User} and the scale of its ambition are increasing. And BCIs could open the door to remarkable new application. Entrepreneurs envisage a world in which people can communication telepathically, with each other and with machines, or acquire superhuman abilities, such as hearing at very high frequencies.
\par
\section{That thinking feeling}
\par The BrainGate system\cite{Vogel2014Continuous} used by Mr kochevar was developed more than ten years ago, but only a handful of people have tried it out. The path to the mainstream is blocked by three formidable barriers-technological, scientific and commercial.
\par
\section{Like a hole in the head }
\par The third obstacle comprises the practical barriers to commercialisation. It takes time, money and expertise to get medical devices approved. And consumer applications will take off only if they perform a function people find useful.\\

\par These question are not urgent. And it is not the realm of pure fantasy. Technology changes the way people live.
