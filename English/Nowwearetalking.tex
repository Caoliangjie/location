\maketitle
\par Voice technology\cite{Wikipedia2011Voice} is making computers less daunting and more accessible. Using voice computing\cite{Beritelli2006A} is just like casting a spell(see Fig.{\color{red}1}): say a few words into the air, and a nearby device can grant your wish. And more companies think dictating e-mails and text message now works reliable enough. This is a huge shift. Simple thought it may seem, voice has the power to transform computing, by providing a natural means of interaction. But Voice will not wholly replace other forms of input and output.

\par However, to reach its full potential, the technology requires further breakthroughs-and a resolution of the tricky questions it raises around the trade-off between convenience and privacy. Many voice-driven devices\cite{Schimmer2002VOICE} are always listening, waiting to be activated. Some people are already concerned about the implications of internet-connected microphones listening in every room and from every smartphone. Even if such issues remain unresolved, consumers will adopt voice computing as always.
