\maketitle
\par There is a phenomenon that women ask fewer questions than men\cite{Kuo2017Women} at seminars (see Fig. {\color{red}1}), for which the hypothesis is supported by data in a new working paper. One theory to explain the low share of women\cite{Holst2014Financial} in senior academic jobs is that they have less self-confidence than men.

\par On average, half of each seminar¡¯s audience was female. Men, however, were over 2.5 times more likely to pose question to the speakers-an action that may be viewed as a sign of greater competence. When a women did so, the gender split in question-asking was, on average , proportional to that of the audience. But if a man did so, there will be a reverse result depending on who asked the first question.
